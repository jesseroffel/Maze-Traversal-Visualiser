# Maze Traversal Visualiser

Out of interest I decided to look into maze generation algorithms and how they work and got quite excited to implement these concepts myself. With this personal project I plan to implement multiple maze generation algorithms and visualise their traversal process.



## Goal

This project is written in C++ using Unreal Engine 4, the goal is to create an small editor plugin that can be configured to generate maze like structures by setting the desired algorithm method, cell arrangement and visualisation options.




### Editor options and algorithms

I plan to provide editor functionality on how the grid should be set up and configured. This is using property fields which should visualise the result on runtime or will be able to generated and saved as an asset.
